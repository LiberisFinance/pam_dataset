# pam_dataset

This repo contains 2 separate pieces of work:

1. A series of notebooks for constructing a 'PAM-ready' dataset and uploading it to our DWH ('1 dataset_raw.ipynb -> 5 dataset_PAMready.ipynb)
2. Some analysis on marketing effectiveness vs seasonality, and an attempt at building a marketing propensity (likelihood to respond) model

The dataset is too big to store on GitHub (413 MB). It must be downloaded from OneDrive and unzipped into the data folder. Link: https://liberis365.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Risk/Shared%20Documents/dataScience/dataSources/wp%20pam%20dataset?csf=1&web=1&e=IdKIub

NB: There was an error with MIDs is Oct-19's file, the 'Fix October file.ipynb' notebook fixes that issue. (The fix should already be applied to the data in this repo, the notebook is only included for posterity)
